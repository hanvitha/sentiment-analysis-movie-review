    "# Sentiment Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Hi 🙂, if you are seeing this notebook, you've succesfully started your first project on FloydHub, hooray! 🚀\n",
    "\n",
    "[Sentiment analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis) is one of the most common [NLP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural-language_processing) problems. The goal is to analyze a text and predict whether the underlying sentiment is positive, negative or neutral. \n",
    "*What can you use it for?* Here are a few ideas - measure sentiment of customer support tickets, survey responses, social media, and movie reviews! \n",
    "\n",
    "### Predicting sentiment of movie reviews\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will build a [Convolutional Neural Network](http://www.wildml.com/2015/11/understanding-convolutional-neural-networks-for-nlp/) (CNN) classifier to predict the sentiment (positive or negative) of movie reviews. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "We will use the [Stanford Large Movie Reviews](http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/) dataset for training our model. The dataset is compiled from a collection of 50,000 reviews from IMDB. It contains an equal number of positive and negative reviews. The authors considered only highly polarized reviews. Negative reviews have scores ≤ 4 (out of 10), while positive reviews have score ≥ 7. Neutral reviews are not included. The dataset is divided evenly into training and test sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will:\n",
    "- Preprocess text data for NLP\n",
    "- Build and train a 1-D CNN using Keras and Tensorflow\n",
    "- Evaluate our model on the test set\n",
    "- Run the model on your own movie reviews!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "- To execute a code cell, click on the cell and press `Shift + Enter` (shortcut for Run).\n",
    "- To learn more about Workspaces, check out the [Getting Started Notebook](get_started_workspace.ipynb).\n",
    "- **Tip**: *Feel free to try this Notebook with your own data and on your own super awesome sentiment classification task.*\n",

Is it the acting, the poor directing? OK so it's made for TV, but why watch a bad copy, when you can get your hands on the superb original? Especially as you'll be spoiled to the plot and won't enjoy the original as much, as if you've watched it first! <br /><br />There are a few things that are different from the original (it's shorter for once), but all are for the worse! The actors playing the parts here, just don't fit the bill! You just don't believe them and who could top Edward G. Robinsons performance from the original? If you want, only watch it after you've seen the original and even then you'll be very brave, if you watch it through! It's almost sacrilege! \n",
